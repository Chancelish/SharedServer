This folder contains all of the Documentation for our shared server. Make a separate folder for your teams specific part of the server. Be sure to include your .tex files so we can build documentation and better keep track of changes.

If you include any images in your documentation, they must be included with your .tex file when you push up to this branch so when we build documentation, the images are also included.
